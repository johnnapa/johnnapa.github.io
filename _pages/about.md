## About Me

<img align="right" width="180" src="https://johnnapa.github.io/images/new/Bg_1.png" />
In everything I do, I've always had a knack for learning new things. And in the world of data science, where information is always pouring in, I couldn't be more thrilled. Pairing my love for learning with my fascination for programming, I've charted my course to become a professional in the field of data science.  
  
As a goal-oriented individual, I constantly strive to set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that align with my values and aspirations, and I relentlessly pursue them with dedication, perseverance, and a growth mindset.  
  
Backed by my experience in **Python, statistics, spreadsheets, and Tableau**, I'm eager to dive into diverse datasets and uncover valuable insights. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of data together. Contact me to embark on your data-driven journey.

## Notable Projects

**1. Employee Retention Data Analysis in Python**\
In this project, I explored a dataset from the human resources department of a company to analyze trends in employee retention based on the how satisfaction rate of employees were affected by various factors in the company. Harnessing my knowledge in statistics and machine learning model creation, I utilized various **python** analytics modules such as **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn** to properly identify retention rate of employees to pave a path for propely company resource allocations.\

**2. SuperStore Sales Dashboard in Excel**\
Data Visualization is a key skill of a Data Analyst. In this project, I analyzed a dataset on a store sales and created a dashboard in Excel leveraging on various features of the application. I employed a variety of skills including the creation of Pivot Tables to effectively aggregate data, development of dynamic charts for visual representation, and organization of VBA codes to automate computational tasks and streamline data retrieval processes.\
